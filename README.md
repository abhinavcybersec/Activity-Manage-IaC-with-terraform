# Activity Overview
Examining a Terraform configuration file used to automate infrastrucutre and identify how different pieces of code affect the infrastrucutre. <br>
IaC is the practice of provisioning and managing infrastructure using resuable scripts. IaC's automation capabilities are important in cloud computing. Automation reinforces an organization's security posture by
incorporating security checks early in the software development process. Automation also helps ensure developers across teams use the same source code when creating infrastructure for virtual machines and 
applications.

## Scenario
- Recently joined the Cymbal Bank security team as a JUNIOR CLOUD SECURITY ANALYST
- Responsibility to ensure that VM are correctly configured and deployed using IaC.
- To make sure that VMs are consistent across Cymbal Bank's hybrid cloud.

## Task
- Create server instances
- Install software based on standard Terraform installation template
- Review the Terraform file before deploying it

## Goals for Project
- **Goal 1:** Examine a Terraform configuration file.
- **Goal 2:** Describe what cloud resources the different pieces of code create in the file.
- **Goal 3:** Identify how to change a virtual machine's location.
- **Goal 4:** Explain how incorporating IaC can improve security.
